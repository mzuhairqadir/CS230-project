# CS230-project
The basic model is located in yolo.py. That got scrapped shortly afterward, so the majority of our work was done using pre-trained models of YOLO and FaceNet, as mentioned in our citations.

The main code we used in the implementation of our pipeline is in image_crop and speed_comp, to create the datasets that on which we trained our models.

The models we used may be found at
